# HTTP/2

HTTP/2 functionality was added in v3.17. It is a full implementation of the HTTP/2 standard and can be used with other HTTP servers (such as Nginx) for forwarding.

As suggested by HTTP/2 standards, both the client and the server must enable TLS for this transport mode to work properly.

Since v4.20, the mandatory TLS configuration for the server was removed. In order to allow the external gateway component to complete the TLS conversation in a special deployment environment, V2Ray, as a backend application, communicates with the gateway using plaintext HTTP/2, called `h2c`.

## HttpObject

`HttpObject` corresponds to the `httpSettings` element in the transport configuration.

```json
{
    "host": [
        "v2ray.com"
    ],
    "path": "/random/path",
    "method":"PUT",
    "headers": {
    }
}
```

> `host`: \[string\]

An array of strings, each of which is a domain name. The client randomly selects a domain name from the list for use, and the server verifies that the domain name is in the list.

> `path` string

The HTTP hyperlink, starting with `/`. Must be consistent between the client and server configurations. Optional parameter, default value is `"/"`.

> `method`: string

(Since v4.39.0) The HTTP request method, default value is `"PUT"`.

> `headers`: map{ string, \[ string \]}

(Since v4.39.0) HTTP headers. A list of key-value pairs, each key represents a HTTP header.
